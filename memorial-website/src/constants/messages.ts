    message: `I am so proud of you, Lyza, for the incredible person you grew
    to beâ€”so strong, resilient, and kind. None of us can truly put
    into words the deep loss we feel with you gone. But I won't let
    myself stay down; I know you wouldn't want that for me. I want
    you to know how much I love you, and I promise to live in a way
    that you would be proud of. I'll live for both of us, gathering
    stories to share when we meet again. I miss you more than words
    can say. I love you forever. Goodbye for now.`,

    message: `To my Pure Lyt, my precious daughter, though you are no longer with us
      and now rest in God's embrace, I pray that you watch over us each day and
      help guide us toward the life you always dreamed of. I want you to know
      how deeply I love you, and even though you have left this world, there is
      not a single day that passes without me missing you. Wherever you are, I
      feel your presence, and I know you will never truly leave us. Thank you
      for all the beautiful memories you have given us; they are an
      irreplaceable gift. Mama will always love you endlessly, and I hope you
      feel that love wherever you are. Even if words sometimes fail or are
      misunderstood, God knows the truth in my heart and the love I hold for
      you. I love you, Ate Lyza. May Jesus be with you always. Amen.`,
