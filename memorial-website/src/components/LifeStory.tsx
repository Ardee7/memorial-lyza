        Lyza's Story Through the Eyes of Kuya

        Childhood
      </Typography>
      <Typography1>
        In the beginning, it was the three of us: Me (Kuya), Ate Raine, and
        Lyza. With me as the only boy among the siblings, Lyza brought an energy
        that filled every corner of our childhood. Her name, Lyza Kate
        Villanueva Lachica, resonates with the laughter and boundless spirit she
        carried for twenty years, ever since she was born on June 9, 2004. Lyza
        grew up full of life, a bright spark in the classroom and the ringleader
        of all the neighborhood games. Pictures of our childhood capture a
        vibrant little girl with a fearless smile, always at the center of play,
        surrounded by friends she made so effortlessly. She was the one the
        elders would lovingly tease, calling her the neighborhood's “little
        firecracker,” known for leading other kids in endless, joyful noise. At
        school, it was no different. She was a shining star, always on the honor
        roll, always surrounded by people drawn to her magnetic, spirited
        nature.

        Our family story was not without its struggles. Lyza, Ate Raine and I
        grew up with our parents working overseas, leaving our upbringing in the
        hands of caring relatives. Yet even in this, we found strength, learning
        to appreciate the beauty in life's imperfections. When our family
        reunited, it marked a new chapter, one full of sibling games and shared
        adventures. Lyza often followed me, playing whatever I played, and her
        adventurous, tomboyish side grew alongside mine. But, being just a
        child, I didn't notice the subtle shadows of the health challenges that
        would later shape her journey. In elementary school, Lyza's struggles
        began to surface. Dizzy spells and urinary tract infections (UTI) seemed
        to come and go, dismissed as part of a lively child's growing pains.
        Sometimes her eyes would redden, and she would have trouble walking. We
        were relieved when these episodes passed, not understanding the depth of
        what she was facing. Then came sixth grade and a bout with chickenpox
        that marked a turning point. It robbed her of the ability to walk
        temporarily, then her hearing began to fade. The diagnosis that followed
        was devastating: Cogan syndrome. By the time the news settled, Lyza had
        lost her hearing entirely.
      </Typography1>
      <Typography1>
        Life changed drastically. Lyza decided not to continue in a regular high
        school, her world having become a place where familiar faces felt
        distant and the noise of life had gone silent. The grief was palpable,
        but so was her will to find a way forward. Lyza eventually chose to
        enroll at Pasay School for the Deaf (PSD), where she learned to navigate
        her new reality. Those early days were dark, as she faced the heartbreak
        of being suddenly cut off from a world she had once known so intimately.
        But with immense courage, she found purpose again.

      <Typography1>
        At PSD, Lyza's vibrant spirit re-emerged. She mastered sign language
        with remarkable speed, her old brilliance shining through in every
        academic challenge. Her name consistently graced the honor roll, and she
        became a leader in her own way, whether directing school projects or
        joining dance performances, even when she wasn't supposed to exert
        herself. Being at school seemed to breathe new life into her, as if the
        support of her teachers and friends kept her health complications at
        bay, even for a while.

        High school became a chapter where Lyza tasted the joys and heartaches
        of youth. She experienced the ups and downs of friendship, the
        excitement of young love, and the bittersweet lessons that come with
        growing up. Surrounded by a community that loved her for who she was,
        she carved out a life as full and joyful as she could have ever hoped.
        Her high school journey brought back pieces of the normalcy she had
        thought she'd lost, and for that, we are endlessly grateful.

        Senior High School
      </Typography>
      <Typography1>
        In senior high, Lyza remained the same spirited soul, surrounded by the
        same friends who had journeyed with her through thick and thin. Their
        bond never wavered; they continued studying together, facing the growing
        mountain of schoolwork and projects that senior high demanded. Despite
        the increased academic pressure and frequent medical check-ups, Lyza
        kept her eyes set on a dream she held dearly: going to college and one
        day becoming successful enough to give back to all who had loved and
        supported her.
      </Typography1>
      <Typography1>
        Graduating with honors was a testament to her hard work, and her
        dedication was recognized with a scholarship offer from the School of
        Saint Benilde. But life, ever unpredictable, threw another challenge her
        way. During the admission interview, her vision, already clouded like
        cataracts—though it was actually ghost vessels—betrayed her. She
        struggled to see clearly, and this devastating blow forced her to put
        her college plans on hold. The news plunged her into another dark
        chapter, one marked by grief and a sense of distance from the future she
        so desperately wanted.
      </Typography1>
      <Typography1>
        Yet through this time, Ate Raine and Papa became her steadfast pillars
        of strength, offering the emotional support she needed. The weight of
        watching her friends move forward while she had to stop was heavy, and
        Lyza, in her pain, withdrew from them. She longed for her friends to
        understand, even as she felt herself pulled further away from the life
        she envisioned. Jealousy and sadness settled in as dreams seemed to slip
        from her grasp.
      </Typography1>
      <Typography1>
        Then, a glimmer of hope appeared: she was scheduled for an operation
        that might restore her eyesight. The prospect filled her with renewed
        faith, a belief that maybe, just maybe, life would turn a corner. But
        sadly, her body had endured more than it could bear, and fate, in its
        harsh finality, had other plans.

        Lyza's story is one of a girl who found ways to shine despite the storms
        life brought her way. A girl who showed us all what true resilience

        will always be remembered.
